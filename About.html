        <p>
    I started this business in 2002 after quitting my full time job. 
    Working 80 hours a week and living paycheck to paycheck. My children 
    and I were not in a good space. 
        </p>
<p>
    I needed to make a change. I've always loved fashion and could never find hijabs to match my style. This is 
    where I came in and changed the game. 
    </p>
<p>
    I was able to design these scarves and have my manufacturers in UAE bring them to life. All of you all have 
    made it possible for me to continue this journey, THANK YOU!
